• Pharmacy Management System (C#)
    Key Features and Functionality:
    
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: The system effectively utilizes core OOP principles:
    
    Encapsulation: Data fields are kept private, and constructors create new ArrayLists for data fields to prevent direct reference returns, ensuring immutability.

    Polymorphism: PharmacyItems is an abstract superclass, with printOrderDetails() as an abstract function implemented differently in subclasses. The 
    
    PharmacyManager uses polymorphism to display various pharmacy items (drugs, equipment) and members.

    Inheritance: Classes like Drugs, HealthCareProduct, and Equipment inherit from the PharmacyItems abstract class.

    Interfaces: Sellable and Rentable interfaces are implemented to categorize items based on their features, allowing for                     specific behaviors like sell() and rent().

    System Components:
 
    Pharmacy Manager: Manages PharmacyItems and Members, with functionalities to add/remove items and members, and display                         them.

    Order: Handles order creation, including adding/removing items, calculating total price, and displaying order details.             It processes items, checking if they are Sellable or Rentable.
  
    Member: Manages member information.

    Pharmacy Items (Abstract Class): A superclass for all pharmacy products, with common attributes like itemId, Name, and                                         quantity, and abstract methods for order details.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Drugs: Inherits from PharmacyItems and implements Sellable, with specific attributes like genericname, drugID,                         sellingprice, requiresPrescription, and expiryDate.
    
    
    
    HealthCareProduct: Inherits from PharmacyItems and implements Sellable, with attributes such as type, brand,                                     sellingprice, and expiryDate.
    
    
    
    Equipment: Inherits from PharmacyItems and implements Rentable, with attributes like equipmentID, model, rent_per_hour,                 and condition.
    
    
    
    Exception Handling: The system incorporates robust exception handling to manage unexpected errors and ensure stability.
    
    
    IllegalArgumentException: Used for invalid data inputs such as negative prices, quantities, or null/empty strings for                                 critical fields (e.g., in DrugItem, Equipment, HealthCareProduct, and Order constructors).
 
    InvalidPrescriptionException (Custom): Thrown for issues related to prescriptions, such as null/empty expiry dates,                                                 expired products, or missing prescriptions for drugs that require them.

    OutOfStockException: Prevents invalid sales or rentals when items are out of stock or have expired.
  
    PaymentException (Custom): Ensures the payment method is not null or empty in the Order class.
    
    Graphical User Interface (GUI): The system features a GUI for user interaction, including:
    
    Sales Interface 
    
    Inventory Management 
    
    Equipment Rental System 
    
    Search functionality for inventory 
    
    Promo code functionality and discount application 
   
    Member Management System 
    
    Detailed receipt generation for sales and rentals 
    
    User-friendly design 
    
    Designed a user-friendly interface and optimized data retrieval for better efficiency.
